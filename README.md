# Network-dynamics-and-learning-polito
This repository provides a brief description and report of the exercises done for the course Network dynamics and learning for the A.Y. 2022/2023

Some of the reports are not totally correct, in particular: 
- Homework 1 exercise 3.g, the result is correct but the computation steps are not totally correct 
- Homework 2 exercise 1.f, the method used to obtain the conclusion is not correct 
- Homework 2 exercise 1.g, some conclusions related to the obtained graph are not correct 
- Homework 2 exercise 3.a.2, the last node has been set to fixed rate instead of proportional rate (the text was not clear, so it depends on the interpretation)
